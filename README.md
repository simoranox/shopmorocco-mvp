# ShopMorocco MVP

This is a lightweight React + Vite + Tailwind starter for the ShopMorocco MVP we discussed.

## Quick start (locally)
1. Install Node.js (>=18 recommended).
2. In the project folder run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open http://localhost:5173

## Deploy to Vercel (temporary account)
1. Create a new GitHub repo and push this project.
2. Go to https://vercel.com, create an account (or temporary).
3. Import the GitHub repo and deploy (Vercel auto-detects Vite).
4. After deploy, you'll get a live link.

## Notes
- The project uses static product data (src/data/products.js).
- Language switcher (EN/FR/AR) is built-in; Arabic toggles RTL automatically.
- Payment & backend are not yet integrated â€” next step.
